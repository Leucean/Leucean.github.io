                    Leucean Cahatane-Leure was born in the year 628 in the city of Taurangit in Felamoatu. They have
                    mixed heritage, Felas and Serbluequer parents. Their father is a descendant of the legendary
                    Cahatane lineage, while their mother served as a Serbleuquer diplomat. <br /><br />
                    Their name ironically means "born of the river" in their native Serbleux even though they were born
                    by the ocean - their parents were unoriginal with names, naming them after Leucean Fereux, Third
                    Chancellor of Serbleuque.
                    <br /><br />
                    Leucean was a keen explorer. They spend their free time roaming around cities and nature, quietly
                    observing the people and the places. The Wharote Langkit, the biggest observatory at the time, was
                    Leucean's favourite place to be. They would spend hours relaxing and cloud-watching and stargazing
                    at night.
                    <br /><br />
                    Leucean was always drawn to the ocean. Whenever the water called, they would be in a Wakerang,
                    sailing. After Leucean's coming of age, they chose to join their local pearl-diving guild instead of
                    following in their parents' diplomatic footsteps - much to their parents' chagrin.
                    <br /><br />
                    It was on a pearl-diving expedition that Leucean found their treasured moonstone. While underwater
                    off the coast of Palau Laiwani, a sudden storm formed over him. When they attempted to resurface
                    with the oysters he had gathered, the stormy waves swept them away from their Wakerang.
                    <br /><br />
                    They woke up on a beach, somehow alive despite drowning. The sack of the oysters they had gathered
                    was empty - save for the glittering moonstone at the bottom. They had somehow floated to Palu
                    Taiwiti, the westernmost island governed by Felamoatu.
                    <br /><br />
                    They eventually returned to Taurangit after their near death, albeit a bit shaken. However, the
                    incident renewed their desire to explore - they wanted to see as much of the world before they grew
                    old and unable to.
                    <br /><br />
                    Driven by their desire for adventure and a renewed purpose, Leucean set out to explore the rest of
                    the world.
