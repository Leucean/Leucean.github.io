	<p style="text-align:justify">I'm pretty easy to find! Sometimes, you will see me with a nub; sometimes, you will see me with a looooong tail. But you will definitely see me running around and causing trouble!</p>

	<h2>Dos and Do Nots</h2>
	<h3>Do:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Say hi to me</li>
		<li>Ask me for a hug</li>
		<li>Ask me to hang out</li>
		<li>Ask me for a photo</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3>Do NOT:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Touch me without consent</li>
		<li>Assume I can hear you</li>
		<li>Grab my tail</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p style="text-align:justify;">Please keep in mind that costume is <b>NOT</b> consent.<br><br>When wearing a fursuit, your vision and hearing will be <b>VERY</b> impaired. If you need to catch my attention, you should speak near my fursuit's cheek or ears! If you want me to see you, try to be slightly off-centre of my muzzle! When you stand directly in front of me, most of the time I can't see you! </p>
